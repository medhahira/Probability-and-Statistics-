# Probability-and-Statistics-
This is a project I did as a part of my Mathematics course of Probability and Statistics at my college Indraprastha Institutre of Information Technology, Delhi.

The python project uses mathplotlib and numpy to help me plot the graphs.

STEPS FOLLOWED WHILE CODING:
- hard coded a list consisting of thirty numbers
- found the average(mean), standard deviation and variance of the data set. 
- expanded my code to be able to find the average(mean), standard deviation and variance of the data set upto the i(th) number
- made functions to help me calculate the gaussian and exponential function of the data set.
- plot a relative frequency line graph of your data (if you prefer using the frequencies instead of relative frequencies, that is also fine). Plot a graph of the exponential and normal pdfs using the sample mean and variance you have computed (of all 30 observations), as parameters. Decide which one matches better.

Using python to create a project like this helped me further my undrestanding of the course and helped me visualize the data set.
