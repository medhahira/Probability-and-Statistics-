# Probability-and-Statistics-
This is a project I did as a part of my Mathematics course of Probability and Statistics at my college Indraprastha Institutre of Information Technology, Delhi.

The python project uses mathplotlib and numpy to help me plot the graphs.
STEPS FOLLOWED WHILE CODING:
- hard coded a list consisting of thirty numbers
- found the average(mean), standard deviation and variance of the data set. 
- expanded my code to be able to find the average(mean), standard deviation and variance of the data set upto the i(th) number
- made functions to help me calculate the gaussian and exponential function of the data set.
- used the values acquired in the previous steps to plot graphs and visualize the distribution curves.

Using python to create a project like this helped me further my undrestanding of the course and helped me visualize the data set.
